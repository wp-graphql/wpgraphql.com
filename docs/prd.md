## Known Issues & Limitations
1. Blog post titles in breadcrumbs require async loading
2. Image handling in blog posts needs max-width constraints
3. Navigation state persistence across page loads

## Technical Debt
1. Duplicate prose styles in globals.css
2. Complex breadcrumb logic could be simplified
3. Navigation state management could be centralized
4. Content fetching strategy could be optimized
