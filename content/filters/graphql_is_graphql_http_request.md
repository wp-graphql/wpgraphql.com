Filter whether the request is a GraphQL HTTP Request. Default is false, as the majority
of WordPress requests are NOT GraphQL requests (at least today that's true ðŸ˜†).
The request has to "prove" that it is indeed an HTTP request via HTTP for
this to be true.
Different servers _might_ have different needs to determine whether a request
is a GraphQL request.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| is_graphql_http_request | `bool` | Whether the request is a GraphQL HTTP Request. Default false. |
