Filter whether the request is a GraphQL HTTP Request. Default is null, as the majority
of WordPress requests are NOT GraphQL requests (at least today that's true ðŸ˜†).
If this filter returns anything other than null, the function will return now and skip the
default checks.

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| is_graphql_http_request | `bool` | Whether the request is a GraphQL HTTP Request. Default false. |

## Examples

```php
add_filter('graphql_pre_is_graphql_http_request', function($value, $is_graphql_http_request) {
    // Modify $value here
    return $value;
});
